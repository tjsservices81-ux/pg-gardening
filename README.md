## Putting the real details in

The site ships with visible placeholders instead of invented phone numbers.
One command replaces every one of them — header, footer, contact page, sticky
mobile call bar, structured data, sitemap and `config.js`:

```bash
node tools/setup.mjs \
  --phone1 "01254 123456" --label1 "Office" \
  --phone2 "07700 900123" --label2 "Mobile" \
  --email  "you@yourdomain.co.uk" \
  --domain "https://www.yourdomain.co.uk"
```

Add `--dry-run` to see what it would change without changing anything. Run it
again whenever a detail changes.

### Where the content lives

Nothing is edited in `assets/js/` any more — those three files are generated.
The originals are plain files under `content/`, and the admin panel at
`/admin` is a friendly front end onto them:

- **`content/settings.json`** — Facebook URLs, Google Business Profile links,
  GA4 measurement ID, and the trade directory listings with an on/off switch
  each. Anything switched off, or left empty, is not rendered on the site at
  all rather than shown as a dead link.
- **`content/reviews/*.json`** — one file per review left through the form on
  this site. A review appears only once `approved` is `true`. Google reviews
  must not be copied in here — their terms forbid it.
- **`content/reviews-collected.json`** — the reviews gathered away from the
  website, in person and by text. `"enabled": false` takes the whole set off.
- **`content/pairs/*.json`** and **`content/photos/*.json`** — before/after
  sliders and standalone photos added through the panel.

Run `node tools/build-content.mjs` after editing any of them by hand.

---

## Running it locally

Any static server will do. The pages use root-relative paths (`/assets/...`),
so opening the HTML files directly off the disk will not load the CSS —
serve them instead:

```bash
npx serve .          # then open http://localhost:3000
# or
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

To preview content changes before pushing:

```bash
node tools/build-content.mjs
```

---

## Deploying

Hosted on Netlify from this repository. Push to the deployment branch and it
rebuilds.

`netlify.toml` sets one build command:

```
node tools/build-content.mjs
```

That regenerates `config.js`, `reviews-data.js` and `photo-manifest.js` from
`content/` and the gallery folders, which is what makes "save it in the admin
panel and it goes live" true. There is no other build step.

### Forms

Three Netlify forms: `quick-quote` (home page), `quote` (contact page) and
`review` (reviews page). All three have a honeypot field and reCAPTCHA.

**After the first deploy, turn on email notifications:** Netlify → Forms →
Settings → Form notifications → add an email notification. Without it,
enquiries collect in the dashboard and nobody sees them.

## Notes for whoever works on this next

- **British English throughout** — organise, colour, metre, licence (noun) /
  license (verb), kerb, tyre. Prices in £, dates DD/MM/YYYY, UK phone formats.
- **Nothing invented**, with one flagged exception. No years in business, job
  counts, awards, accreditations, insurance figures, qualification numbers,
  prices or addresses appear anywhere unless the owner has confirmed them.
  Where one is needed it is a visible `.pending` marker. Please keep it that
  way.
- **Reviews come from two places and are not interchangeable.**
  `content/reviews/*.json` are the ones left through the form on this site;
  they print "Left on this website" underneath, and only appear once the owner
  approves them. `content/reviews-collected.json` holds the 200 gathered away
  from the site — in person, by text and on Facebook — confirmed genuine by
  the owner; they carry no provenance line, because that claim would not be
  true of them. Do not move records between the two, and do not copy Google
  reviews into either: Google's terms forbid republishing them, and publishing
  anything that is not genuine is an offence under the DMCC Act 2024.
- **No review or rating schema.** Google's guidelines forbid marking up
  reviews collected on Google, and it risks a manual penalty. The site
  carries `LocalBusiness`, `Service`, `BreadcrumbList` and `FAQPage` markup
  only.
- **Consent before analytics.** No analytics cookie is set and no Google
  script is fetched until the visitor presses accept. Do not "simplify" this
  into a notice bar — that is not valid consent under UK law.
- **A before/after pair is never shown half-finished.** The manifest builder
  drops any unmatched pair and warns in the deploy log.
- **Accessibility:** every text/background pair meets WCAG AA contrast, the
  whole site is keyboard navigable, the before/after sliders work with arrow
  keys, and everything animated respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Layout is verified at 320, 390, 768, 1024 and 1440px** with no horizontal
  scrolling at any width. If you add a grid, use
  `minmax(min(280px, 100%), 1fr)` rather than a bare `minmax(280px, 1fr)` —
  the bare version forces the page wider than a small phone screen.
